# Viewing all bookings

To view all bookings, you need to go from the main menu to the "Bookings" ➡️ "View All" section.

The opened page will look as follows:

In the image:

1 — Search field for the list (search is performed across all columns of the table).&#x20;

2 — Filtering by booking status (all, fully paid, partial payment made, awaiting confirmation, canceled, expired).&#x20;

3 — Filtering by the creator of the booking from among the Dashboard system users.&#x20;

4 — Refreshing the list.&#x20;

5 — List of all bookings displayed as a table. The table consists of the following columns:

* Booking creation date;
* Check-in date;
* Check-out date;
* Number of guests;
* Total booking amount;
* Amount of prepayment made;
* Status indicating whether the order is fully paid;
* Status indicating whether the order is canceled;
* Expand button to view order details.

By default, all entries in the table are sorted by booking creation date. To sort the table by any other column, simply click on the column header.

All rows in the table are highlighted according to the order status:

* Fully paid: light green;
* Partial payment made: blue;
* Awaiting confirmation: yellow-green;
* Canceled: gray;
* Expired: red (bookings become expired if no prepayment is made within an hour after the booking is created).

At the bottom of the table, the following information is provided:

6 — Selection of the number of rows to display per page.&#x20;

7 — Total number of bookings and the range of visible bookings.&#x20;

8 — Navigation arrows for table pagination.

Clicking on the button located in the last column of the table expands detailed information about the booking, displayed as follows:

First, the clients listed in the booking are listed (1), along with brief information about the client and the room reserved for the client. The client's name serves as a link to their page.

Next is the information email sending form (2): an email input field, a selection for the email type, and a send button. This form is only available for confirmed bookings.

Below the form is the email sending history (3): when, at what time, to which email, and by which staff member the email was sent.

If the booking was created by a Dashboard user or an authorized client in their personal account, the creator of the booking will be indicated (see the example in the image below).

At the very bottom of the expanded card, there are quick operation buttons for the booking on the left (4), and an edit booking button on the right (5).

The quick operation buttons for the booking vary depending on the booking status. For a booking awaiting confirmation, the available buttons are "Confirm Booking," "Fully Paid," and "Cancel Booking" (see example in the image below). For a confirmed booking, the buttons are "Fully Paid" and "Cancel Booking." For a fully paid or expired booking, only the cancel button is available. And for a canceled booking, there are no quick operation buttons.

Example of a booking awaiting confirmation:
