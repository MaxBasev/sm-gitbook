# User Tasks

#### Viewing User Tasks

The first screen that opens upon logging into the system is the User To Do. By default, the tab displaying the list of all tasks is opened.

In the image:

1 — User selection field: It allows choosing the user whose tasks need to be viewed. This field is only available to employees with the corresponding access level. If the field is not available, the tasks of the current user are selected by default.

2 — Current user tasks: These tasks are sorted by the priority level of execution.

3 — Completed user tasks: These tasks are sorted by the completion time.

All tasks are characterized by: \
a) Deadline for task completion (which may be absent). \
b) Execution priority.

Tasks are differentiated by high, medium, low, or no priority.

#### Completing and Cancelling User Tasks

To complete or cancel a task, as well as to view its history, you need to click on the task, which will open the task card (as shown in the image below).

The task card contains:

* The full text of the task.
* Fields for entering the time spent on completing the task.
* The history of operations performed on the task, including information on who created the task and when, how the task text was modified, and when and by whom the task was completed or cancelled.
* The name of the task creator.
* Buttons for completing and cancelling the task.
