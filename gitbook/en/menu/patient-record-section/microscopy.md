### Adding Microscopy

To add microscopy to a patient, you need to click the "Add" button located in the upper right corner of the respective page. The following page will open:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the image::

* information about the patient for whom the microscopy is being created;
* field for entering the date and time of microscopy;
* "Create Microscopy" button.

After clicking the button, the microscopy will be added to the patient, and you will be redirected to the microscopy editing page.

### Editing Microscopy

The microscopy page looks as follows and consists of four parts:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. Information about the patient.
2. Information about the microscopy date with editing option.
3. Field for displaying and adding microscopy images.
4. Field for creating and filling out a microscopy questionnaire.
5. Medical report input field.

Let's consider each section in more detail.

#### Microscopy Date

After the patient's information, the microscopy date information is provided. To the right of the date, there is an editing button, as shown below:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you click the button, input fields for a new date will appear, similar to when creating microscopy:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

At the bottom, there are two buttons: "Update" and "Cancel." If the date editing fields were opened but none of the buttons were pressed, a warning will appear when trying to navigate to another page, indicating that not all data were saved.

#### Adding Microscopy Images

The field for adding images looks as shown below:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To add images, click on the "paperclip," after which the standard file selection window will open. After selection, the field will change as follows:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By default, an identifier and the "microscopy" label are added to the file name (to ensure uniqueness of filenames in the system). To cancel a file, click the "cross" below the respective file.

The "Save Images" button is located in the lower right corner of the image input field. The button becomes active only after making changes in the field.

After clicking the button, the field will appear as follows:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Saved images will be displayed at the beginning of the field, and the "Save" button will become unavailable.

To enlarge/download or delete already saved images, hover over the desired image, and two buttons will appear:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The button in the upper right corner marks the image for deletion. To delete the image, confirm the deletion by clicking "Save."

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To restore the image, click the return button located in the place of the delete button, in the upper right corner. After confirming the deletion operation, it will no longer be possible to restore the image.

In the lower right corner of the image, there is a magnification button. Clicking the button will open a pop-up window with an enlarged image and a "Download" button.

#### Questionnaire

By default, a questionnaire is not created, it must be generated manually if necessary.

{% hint style="info" %}
To have the questionnaire appear in the patient's personal account, at least one image must be added and saved to the microscopy.
{% endhint %}

Immediately after creating microscopy, the questionnaire input field consists of two buttons: "Update Questionnaire" and "Generate Questionnaire."

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If changes were made to the questionnaire, the update button will load a list with pre-checked information. In the case of generating a questionnaire, an empty questionnaire will be loaded.

If the questionnaire already exists, the field will look as follows:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

"Save Questionnaire" button located below the table.

#### Medical Report

The field for entering a medical report is located at the bottom of the page.

### Viewing Patient Microscopy

After saving the microscopy, the client's page will change.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The questionnaire and history are hidden by default. To view the questionnaire, click the corresponding button.

To view the history, select the button located at the bottom left of the microscopy card.
