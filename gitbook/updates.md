1. [Physicians schedule](en/menu/doctors-schedule.md) was added to Dashboard (new item in the main menu â€” "Schedule").
2. On the [page of bookings](en/menu/booking-section/viewing-all-bookings.md): when sending emails to clients, for the emails of the category "After deposit info" the choice of the letter language has been added (Russian and English).
3. Added restriction of [procedure list creation](en/menu/patient-record-section/list-of-procedures.md#creating-a-list-of-procedures): amount of days chosen for a procedure may not exceed the amount of procedures. The number of procedures has a higher priority than the number of selected days.
