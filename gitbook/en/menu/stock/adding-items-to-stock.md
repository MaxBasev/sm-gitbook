# Adding items to stock

There are two options for adding items to the stock:&#x20;

1. The item is added to the stock automatically when you enter costs for a new item.&#x20;
2. Adding item manually from the stock page.&#x20;

### Adding item manually&#x20;

To add a item, you need to go to the Stock page and click on the "Add" button located above the table on the right:

1. Input field for the name of the item.&#x20;
2. Item category entry field.&#x20;
3. A field for entering the number of item units in stock at the time of item creation.&#x20;
4. Cancel button.&#x20;
5. "Create" button. The button is available only when all fields are filled in correctly.&#x20;

To exclude the appearance of duplicates, when entering the name and category of the item, a list of already existing names is displayed.
