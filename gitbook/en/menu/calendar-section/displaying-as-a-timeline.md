# Displaying as a Timeline

The second way to display the calendar for the selected period is in the form of a timeline.

In the timeline view, you can also select the display period similar to the list view.&#x20;

The timeline consists of the vertical axis representing available rooms on the left and the horizontal axis representing dates at the top. The bookings are displayed at the intersection of these axes.

When you click on a booking on the timeline, a panel appears on the right side displaying the details of the booking and links to its participants.
