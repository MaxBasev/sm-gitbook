### Functions of the personal account

Immediately after logging into the client's personal account, the page will look something like this:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-29 at 16.37.52.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Внешний вид личного кабинета, настольная версия </p></figcaption></figure>

The desktop version is visually divided into two parts: the menu on the left and the content of the selected menu item on the right.

In the mobile version, the menu is hidden, and the menu button is located in the upper right corner.

At the top of the menu, there is brief information about the client with an avatar. Below that, there are menu items (menu items marked as "Coming soon" are not yet available and will appear over time). Below the menu items, there is a logout button.

Let's consider each available menu item separately.

#### Home page

The home page displays news, notifications, and quick access to certain functions (see example in the image above).

#### Medical records

On the medical records page, you can find the results of medical examinations and doctors' conclusions.

Medical records are divided into four categories:

* Data: various analyses and indicators of your health.
* Doctors' conclusions.
* Files.
* Input information: this section contains data that you brought to the clinic and that does not change over time (for example, your birthplace, inherited diseases, etc.).

#### Microscopy

#### Invoices

On the invoices page, you can view a list of invoices with detailed information for each invoice: when the invoice was issued, which services are included, the total cost of the invoice, and the remaining amount to be paid.

#### Schedule

On the schedule page, you can view the schedule for a specific day. The schedule is usually prepared on Sundays for the following week and may change during the week.

#### Bonus balance

On the balance page, you can view a detailed history of bonus accruals and deductions in the system. The balance is increased by attracting new clients to the Santa Maria clinic through your referral link, which is provided on the main page of the personal account. Deductions from the balance are made by the clinic staff upon invoice issuance, based on your request.
