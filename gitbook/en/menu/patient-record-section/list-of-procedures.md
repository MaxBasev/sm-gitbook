# List of procedures

* [Viewing the list of procedures](list-of-procedures.md#viewing-clients-lists-of-procedures)
* [Creating a list of procedures](list-of-procedures.md#creating-a-list-of-procedures)
* [Editing a list of procedures](list-of-procedures.md#editing-a-list-of-procedures)

Working with the list of procedures is similar to working with the list of tests, with some additional fields when creating a list.

#### Viewing client's lists of procedures

o view all lists of procedures assigned to a client, you need to go to the corresponding menu item in the right panel of the client's page.

The view of the lists is as follows:

2 - Button to create a new list of procedures.&#x20;

3 - Card of an individual list.&#x20;

4 - Information about the date, time, and creator of the list (date and time are set manually when creating/editing the list, by default it is the current time on your computer).&#x20;

5 - Button to edit the list of procedures.&#x20;

6 - Button to view the list in a separate window.&#x20;

7 - The actual list of procedures. The list is presented in the form of a table with the following columns:

* Serial number.
* Procedure name.
* Type (procedure/test/naturopathic).
* Category.
* Quantity.
* Procedure comment.
* Days of the week (from Monday to Saturday) - indicating the preferred days for conducting the procedure.

The window when clicking on the button to view the list in a separate window (6) looks as follows:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-25 at 20.07.11.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2 - Selection of columns to display in the list.&#x20;

3 - Saving the list as a PDF file.&#x20;

4 - The actual list of procedures. It will appear the same way in the file.

#### Creating a list of procedures

To create a list of procedures, you need to either go to the medical record creation page (in this case, the corresponding field should be added to the medical records) or click on the button located on the page for viewing all client lists of procedures.

The page for creating a list of procedures looks as follows:

In the image:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-06-14 at 18.10.47.png (1).jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1 - Link to the previous page.&#x20;

2 - Brief information about the client for whom the list is being created.&#x20;

3 - Package of procedures specified in the current or future order.&#x20;

4 - List of procedures included in the package.

5 - Select the period for which the list is drawn up.

6 - Date and time for which the entry needs to be made.&#x20;

7 - Form for adding procedures to the list.

The creation button is located at the bottom of the page below the form.

The form for adding procedures is shown in the image below.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 19.32.24 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The form for adding procedures within the creation of a medical record looks the same way. The form consists of:

1 - Search/filter field.&#x20;

2 - Selection of procedure type.&#x20;

3 - Selection of category.&#x20;

4 - Button to view only selected procedures.&#x20;

5 - Clear selection list.&#x20;

6 - Table of all available procedures. It consists of the following columns:

* Procedure selection.
* Name.
* Type.
* Category.
* Cost.
* Field for entering the quantity of procedures.
* Field for entering a comment about the procedure.
* Columns for selecting the preferred days of the week for performing procedures (from Monday to Saturday, each day has a separate column with a checkbox for selection). Above the name of each day of the week, the number of free hours on that day is indicated (the field is for informational purposes; information is not collected from other lists; it is assumed that only one list of procedures is issued for the specified user for the specified period): the number of hours is obtained from the working hours of the clinic (without taking into account the time of eating) on the specified day minus the total time of the selected procedures; if the time of the procedures exceeds the opening hours of the clinic on that day, the number turns red.

7 — Information about the number of selected procedures and their total cost.&#x20;

8 — Navigating the table.&#x20;

9 — The total time of the clinic without taking into account the time of eating for the selected period.&#x20;

10 — Total time for the selected procedures.&#x20;

11 — Button to save / update the list of procedures.

There is a limit to the number of days of the week selected: you cannot select more days than the number of procedures, but the number of procedures can be specified more than the number of days selected. Thus, the information in the "Count" column has priority over the selected days of the week.

#### Editing a list of procedures

The page for editing a list of procedures is similar to the page for creating a list. Example:
