# Questionnaires

{% hint style="info" %}
At the time of writing this documentation, only one promotional survey - "Health Checker" - is included in the surveys section.
{% endhint %}

Surveys that clients take are located in the corresponding menu item on their page.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Please note!**

Promotional surveys are "linked" to the client through the email provided by the user when taking the survey. If the user's email in the system is incorrect or associated with multiple clients, the survey may be linked to the wrong client.
{% endhint %}

The client's list of surveys looks as follows:
