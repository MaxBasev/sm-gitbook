In the top left corner, there is information about the total cost of all active invoices for the client (1).

The list of invoices is presented as expandable cards with brief information about each invoice (start date, period, total cost, number of procedures, invoice creation time; the invoice status is indicated in the top right corner).

Clicking on a card expands the full view of the invoice with control buttons located above the invoice, as shown in the image below.

Viewing invoices.

When you click on the Invoices menu item on the client's page, a list of all the client's invoices is displayed on the right side of the page.

In the top left corner, there is information about the total cost of all active invoices for the client (1).

The list of invoices is presented as expandable cards with brief information about each invoice (start date, period, total cost, number of procedures, invoice creation time; the invoice status is indicated in the top right corner).

Clicking on a card expands the full view of the invoice with control buttons located above the invoice, as shown in the image below.

Among the control buttons:

* Cancel/Restore invoice button.
* Invoice editing button.
* Button to open the invoice in a new browser window.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Please note!**

When editing an invoice, all procedures are loaded based on the current price list. This means that if there have been any changes in the service prices since the invoice was created, even simply saving the invoice without making changes to the list of procedures will result in the invoice being recalculated using the new prices. This action cannot be undone.
