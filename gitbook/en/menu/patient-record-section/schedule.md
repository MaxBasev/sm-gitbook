# Schedule

The client's procedure schedule is located in the corresponding menu item on the client's page.

All data in the schedule is loaded from the Simplybook system.

The schedule on the client's page in the Dashboard system looks as follows:

In the image:

1 - Button to refresh the schedule.&#x20;

2 - Button to save the schedule as a PDF file.&#x20;

3 - Input fields for specifying the period for which the client's schedule should be displayed.&#x20;

4 - Schedule for the selected period.

When the button to save the schedule as a PDF file is clicked, a pop-up menu opens with the option to choose the orientation of the future document (see image below).
