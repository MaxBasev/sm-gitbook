1 - Button for updating the list of stock items.&#x20;

2 - Search field in the list.&#x20;

3 - Search clear button.&#x20;

4 - Filter the list by category.&#x20;

5 - Button to [add new item to the stock](adding-items-to-stock.md).&#x20;

6 - List of all items in the stock in the form of a table.&#x20;

7 - Enable/disable viewing of hidden items.&#x20;

The items list table consists of the following columns:&#x20;

1. Name&#x20;
2. Category&#x20;
3. Number of units in stock + Button to [adjust the number of units](adjusting-the-quantity-of-stock-items.md) manually.&#x20;
4. The time when the item was last added to the stock.
5. &#x20;The time when the item was last listed from the stock.&#x20;
6. Material actions. There are three actions for working with the material:&#x20;
   * [viewing history](view-history.md);&#x20;
   * [edit material data](stock-item-data-correction.md) (name and category);&#x20;
   * hide/show the material in the table. This field is provided for the convenience of using the table: hiding a material does not affect the state of the material in the system. To view hidden materials, you must select the view of hidden materials (item number 7 in the image above).
