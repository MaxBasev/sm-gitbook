After clicking the button, a page with a form to create a new client opens, as shown in the image below.

The form consists of the following fields:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Phone Number
* Email
* Date of Birth
* City of Residence

{% hint style="info" %}
**Please note**

The email field is crucial for form completion.&#x20;

The email is specifically verified during user registration in the personal account. If the entered email addresses do not match or if there are multiple similar addresses in the system, the user will not be able to access their information in the personal account.&#x20;

The same applies to various promotional surveys and tests where login to the personal account is not required. Only the email entered by the user is verified, and the survey results are associated with the first matching email address in the system or a new one is created if there are no matches.
{% endhint %}

All fields are mandatory and must be filled out.&#x20;

The "Create Client" button, located in the bottom right corner, becomes active only when all the fields are filled correctly.

After clicking the button, the system checks if there is already a client with the same information and if the specified phone number is available. If everything is correct, a new client is created in the system.
