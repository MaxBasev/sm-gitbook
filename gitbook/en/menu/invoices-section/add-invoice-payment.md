In the history, you can cancel any of the operations, but once canceled, it cannot be restored.

To add a new payment, you need to specify the date of payment (by default, the current date is set), select the payment method from the list, and specify the amount.&#x20;

When full payment is reached, the status of the invoice will automatically change to "Paid in full".
