#### Requests for balance withdrawal for external doctors

This menu item is only available to system users with a specific role.

The page will look as follows:

Since requests for fund withdrawal from the personal account can only be made by doctors, the client must have the appropriate status assigned. In the client's personal account, the doctor's status is displayed in the top left panel (1).

To request a balance withdrawal, the client fills out the field in their personal account, indicating where and how the funds should be withdrawn. This information is displayed at the top of the client's page (2).

The user's available balance for withdrawal is also indicated on the page (3), along with a button to refresh the requests (5) and a list of all user requests (4).

The list displays the following information: when the user submitted the request, the status of the request (pending or completed), the amount of funds to be withdrawn, and a button to confirm the transfer of funds to the client.
