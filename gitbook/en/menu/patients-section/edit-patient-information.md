# Edit patient information

To edit patient data, you need to open the patient's page and click on the edit button located in the left panel next to the patient's name.

When editing the data, the same form is used as for creating a new patient. The fields that already have data in the system for the selected patient will be pre-filled (1).

If not all fields are filled, you will need to enter the changes to save them. In addition to entering incorrect data, the edit button (2) is also disabled if no changes have been made.

In addition to the basic fields, the patient data editing page includes a form to change the patient's status in their personal account (this form is available only for certain roles in the system).

The status of the patient in their personal account determines which fields are accessible for the patient to view. By default, all patients in the system are registered as regular patients. The status form is intended for external doctors who refer patients to the clinic through their personal referral link. If a doctor wants to use their personal account only for the referral program, they can select the "Doctor" status, and the fields intended for regular patients will be removed from their personal account. However, if the doctor is also a patient of the clinic, they can have both statuses, "Doctor" and "Patient", assigned to them.

The distinction between an external doctor and a regular patient is not only in their personal account but also in the amount of bonuses received when someone uses their referral link, as well as the ability to request withdrawal of bonuses from their personal account.
