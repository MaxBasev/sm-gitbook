# Editing an invoice

To open an invoice for editing, you need to click on the "Edit" button next to the invoice on the client's page or on the invoice list page.

Before the editing page opens, a warning will appear: "If prices for services have changed since the last invoice modification, the invoice will be recalculated based on the new prices (after saving). Are you sure you want to make changes to the invoice?"

Only after confirmation, the invoice editing page will open.

The invoice editing page is similar to the invoice creation page with some exceptions:

1 — Warning about possible price changes.&#x20;

2 — Invoice status.&#x20;

3 — Old invoice price without discounts.&#x20;

4 — Old invoice price with discounts.&#x20;

5 — "Save Changes" button.&#x20;

6 — "Open Invoice in a New Window" button.

In the image, you can see that the "Create Invoice" button remains available, so if needed, the invoice can be duplicated with minor modifications.
