# Recent invoices

To view the most recently created/edited invoices, go to the "Invoices" ➡️ "Recent" submenu in the main menu. This menu item displays all invoices created or edited in the past eleven days.

By default, when clicking the link in the menu, the invoice viewing window looks as follows:

On the left side, there is a search and sorting panel, as well as the list of recent invoices. On the right side, the selected invoice is displayed. By default, when landing on the page, no invoice is selected.

In the image above:

1 — Selection of the sorting method for recent invoices. By default, the sorting is based on the editing/creation time of the invoice (from newest to oldest), as shown in the image below item 4. If the sorting method is set to user-based, the invoice list will look like this:

Each client's name is listed as a separate item (on the image, each name is obscured for confidentiality), and to view the client's invoices, you need to click on their name, which expands the list of their recent invoices, as indicated by the arrow in the image.

2 — Filter for recent invoices based on categories/statuses. By default, the following categories are selected:

In the list, invoices are highlighted based on the color of their category.

3 — Search for invoices based on client data.

4 — List of invoices with brief descriptions: invoice creation date, total price, number of procedures in the invoice.

After selecting an invoice, the invoice itself is displayed in the right window.

In the top right corner, above the invoice, there are control buttons:

* Cancel/Restore invoice;
* Edit invoice;
* Open invoice in a new window.

The invoice is displayed in the window in the same format as it would appear when printed.

Clicking the "Open invoice in a new window" button opens a page that looks like this:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 22.04.04.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

On the opened page, there is nothing but the invoice itself. This page is designed for printing the invoice.
