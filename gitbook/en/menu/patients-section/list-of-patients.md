The table consists of seven columns:

1. Client's first name
2. Client's last name
3. Date of birth
4. Email
5. Phone number
6. Country of residence
7. Actions

To sort the table by a specific column, you need to click on the column header (2) in the table header (1).

The contents of the table are visually divided into pages. You can view the total number of clients (4), navigate to the previous or next pages (5), and customize the number of clients per page (6) in the table footer (3).

The last column of the table contains a link to the client's page.
