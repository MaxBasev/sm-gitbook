#### Viewing medical records

To view a client's medical records, you need to go to the corresponding menu item on the client's page.

1 - Button to add a new medical record.&#x20;

2 - Selection of which category of records to display.

In addition to individual categories, there are "All" categories that allow viewing records from all categories at once, and "General" categories that display records not belonging to any specific category.

Below the categories, there is a table containing the client's medical records.

The table consists of the first column, which contains the name of the medical field (3), and other columns, each representing a specific date of entering medical records (4).

At the intersection of the date and field name, all medical records for that day in the specified field are displayed. Each record starts with the indication of the entry time (5) and continues with the entered value in the field (6).

#### Adding a new medical record

When clicking on the button to add a new record, a new page opens:

3 - Buttons to select the category of fields to be displayed for filling in.&#x20;

4 - Time to which the new medical record needs to be attached (by default, it is the current date and time).&#x20;

5 - Fields for filling in (according to the selected category).

At the bottom of the page, below the list of all fields in the selected category, there is a button to save the medical records.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Please note!**

Only filled fields are saved.

After saving, it is not possible to make changes to the medical records. Only a new medical record can be created.
{% endhint %}

Since there are various types of medical records, several types of fields for filling in are provided:

* Field for entering short text.
* Text area for entering multiple lines of text.
* Field for entering numbers.
* Field for selecting one option from several provided.
* Field for selecting multiple options from several provided.
* Choice between two options.
* Checkbox field for confirming/not confirming data.
* Field for uploading files.
* Field for assigning tests.
* Field for assigning services (including tests).

Each field is characterized by its name, data input form depending on the field type, units of measurement (if applicable), and previous value (if data has been previously entered in this field for this client).

Examples of some types of fields are shown in the following illustration:
