# Basic Client Information

To access the client's page, there are several ways:

* Go from the table with the list of all patients - the link to the client's personal page is located in the last column of the table.
* Follow the link in the sidebar displaying current clinic guests (clicking on the card reveals detailed booking information and a button to the user's page).
* When viewing the Calendar, clicking on an order in the table or in the diagram will bring up a sidebar with links to each client's page in the order.
* When viewing all orders on the booking page, clicking on an order row reveals detailed information about the order and the clients. The client's name serves as a link to their page.
* Additionally, each Dashboard user has the ability to "pin" clients for quick access. In this case, the link to the clients is located in the upper right corner, on the main menu panel, next to the system user icon.

The client's page looks as follows:
